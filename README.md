Simple polls app written in Django to help me learn:

jQuery: Adding a field to a form dynamicly by pressing a button.
django-crispy-forms: Display said forms.
User Authentication/Oauth2: Industry standard and very usefule to know
Storing IP's/Session ID's/Cookies to prevent multiple voting on the same poll
Google Charts API (important to me)

learn about CBVs(Class Based Views)
learn some slightly more advanced templating techniques

The base code of this project is taken from the two tutorials: Tango With Django and the official Django polls tutorial.
